# 🏛️ DYS Garage Training & Certification Portal

Welcome to the **DYS Education Division’s SharePoint Training App** — a sleek, modern, mobile-friendly VanillaJS web application that delivers structured training, quizzes, and printable certification for staff and partners needing access to DHS SharePoint resources outside the DHS network.

Created with love, code, and coffee by the venerable 💻 [Darian Ross](https://github.com/dariansweb) and blessed by the sacred keystrokes of Open Source awesomeness.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User walks through the training modules**, each with a short lesson and screenshot.
2. **User takes a 6-question quiz** to assess comprehension.
3. **Score is displayed**; if perfect (or passing, customizable), the **Certificate button is unlocked**.
4. On the Certificate screen, user enters their name and generates a beautifully styled **PDF Certificate** with their name and the date.
